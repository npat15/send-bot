Rock Climbing ML Project

Using the SQLite database from: https://www.kaggle.com/dcohen21/8anu-climbing-logbook, wrote a program using TensorFlow and Keras to guess whether certain induviduals in the database would be able to climb certain rock climbs on their first try based on current skill level and previous ascents.
